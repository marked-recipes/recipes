## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
- [ ] 16 ounces of mushrooms
- [ ] 6 tablespoons butter
- [ ] ¼ cup sweet Marsala wine
- [ ] ½ cup white wine
- [ ] 1 cup chicken stock
- [ ] 2 garlic cloves
- [ ] Flour
- [ ] Salt and pepper

## Instructions

- [ ] Split each chicken breast through the middle to make 2 pieces. Place plastic wrap over them and pound each one flat using a meat tenderizer/mallet until they are about a quarter inch thick. Season a good amount of salt and pepper on both sides of each piece. Place some flour on a plate and dredge each piece of chicken in it.
- [ ] Heat the oil over medium-high heat and when the oil is hot fry each piece of chicken for 3-4 minutes on each side until they are golden brown (this may require you to do this in 2 batches). Remove chicken and place them on your serving platter covering them with foil. Carefully soak up any remaining oil with paper towels and discard.
- [ ] Reduce the heat to medium and add butter and mushrooms. Saute mushrooms for 4-5 minutes making sure to season them with salt and pepper lightly. Add marsala wine, sherry, cream, and chicken stock allowing the liquid to reduce slightly - approx. 3 minutes. Pour mushrooms and sauce over chicken and serve. Enjoy!
