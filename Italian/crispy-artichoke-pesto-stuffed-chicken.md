## Ingredients

- [ ] One 12-ounce jar marinated quartered artichoke hearts, drained
- [ ] 1/2 cup pesto
- [ ] 1/2 cup grated Parmesan
- [ ] 6 thin chicken cutlets (4 to 6 ounces each, pounded to 1/8 inch thick)
- [ ] Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- [ ] 4 ounces sliced provolone, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- [ ] 2/3 cup all-purpose flour
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs
- [ ] 4 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

- [ ] Position an oven rack in the upper third of the oven and
preheat to 400 degrees F. Fit a rimmed baking sheet
with a baking rack.
- [ ] Combine the artichoke hearts, pesto and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, 10 to 12 pulses. Set aside.
- [ ] Sprinkle the chicken cutlets with salt and pepper and arrange them pounded-side up on a work surface. Divide the provolone evenly among the cutlets, leaving a 1/4-inch border around the edges, then top evenly with the pesto and artichoke filling. Starting at the short end of each cutlet, roll up to enclose the filling. Secure with a wooden skewer and season with more salt and pepper.
- [ ] Put the flour in a shallow dish. Put the eggs in a second shallow dish and beat until very loose. Mix the breadcrumbs and remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan in a third shallow dish. Coat the chicken roll-ups first in the flour, then dip in the egg, letting any excess drip off. Last, coat fully with the breadcrumb mixture and transfer to a plate.
- [ ] Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Put 3 of the roll-ups in the skillet seam-side down and cook, flipping as needed, until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Wipe out the skillet and heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Cook the remaining roll-ups in the same method, then transfer to the baking sheet. Bake the roll-ups until cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove the skewers before serving.
