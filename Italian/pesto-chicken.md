## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 cups tightly packed fresh basil leaves
- [ ] 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- [ ] 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- [ ] 1 1/2 tsp. (or more) kosher salt, divided
- [ ] 1 oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about 1/2 c.)
- [ ] 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice
- [ ] Cooking spray
- [ ] 1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
- [ ] 2 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts (3-4)
- [ ] 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella

## Instructions

- [ ] Preheat oven to 400°. In a food processor, process basil, oil, pine nuts, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until smooth. Transfer basil mixture to a medium bowl and stir in Parmesan and lemon juice; season with more salt, if needed.
- [ ] Grease an 11"-by-8" baking dish with cooking spray. Pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with pepper and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Arrange in a single layer in prepared dish. Spread pesto all over chicken, spooning a bit more over top.
- [ ] Bake chicken 20 minutes. Remove from oven and top with mozzarella. Continue to bake until chicken is cooked through, an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 165oF, and cheese is melted, 5 to 8 minutes. (Optional: If your baking dish is broiler-safe, broil until cheese is browned, 1 to
2 minutes.)
