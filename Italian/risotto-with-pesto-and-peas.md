## Ingredients

- [ ] Kosher salt
- [ ] 3 leeks (white and light green parts only), thinly sliced
- [ ] 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- [ ] 1 cup arborio rice
- [ ] 1/2 cup dry white wine (optional)
- [ ] 1 cup frozen peas, thawed
- [ ] 3/4 cup diced ham
- [ ] 3/4 cup prepared pesto
- [ ] 1 cup small fresh mozzarella balls or diced fresh mozzarella
- [ ] 1/2 cup grated Parmesan

## Instructions

- [ ] Make the broth: Bring 6 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook until tender, 3 to 4 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Adjust the heat to keep the broth at a gentle simmer.
- [ ] Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon butter in a wide saucepan over medium-high heat .Add the rice and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until almost evaporated, about 1 more minute.
- [ ] Add 2 cups of the hot leek broth to the rice; cook, stirring occasionally, until almost absorbed, about 6 minutes (adjust the heat to keep the risotto at a simmer). Add 1 more cup broth and cook, stirring, until almost absorbed, about 5 more minutes. Add the leeks, peas and 1 more cup broth and cook, stirring, until almost absorbed, about 5 more minutes. Taste the rice: If it is not fully cooked, add a little more broth and continue to cook,
stirring, until al dente.
- [ ] Stir in the ham and remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Remove from the heat; stir in 2/3 cup pesto, the mozzarella and Parmesan. Season with salt. Divide among bowls and top with the remaining pesto.
