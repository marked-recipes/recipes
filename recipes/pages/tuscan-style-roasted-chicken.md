## Ingredients
    * One 6-pound whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces
    * Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
    * Olive oil, for cooking
    * 3 cloves garlic, sliced
    * 4 ounces dry vermouth
* 2 beefsteak tomatoes, cut into eighths
* 1/2 cup pitted green olives (your favorite kind)
* Small bundle fresh oregano, tied with butcher's twine
* 1 1/2 cups chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* Fresh basil, torn, for serving

- ## Directions
- Set up a grill for cooking with direct and indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. Place a large cast-iron pan on the direct-heat side of the grill to preheat.
- Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Add a film of olive oil to the pan, followed by the chicken pieces, skin-side down. Allow the chicken to deeply brown, 4 to 5 minutes, then flip and add the garlic. Briefly sauté until fragrant, then deglaze with the vermouth. Scatter in the tomatoes, olives and oregano bundle. Add the chicken stock and season with
salt and pepper. Move the pan to the indirect-heat side of the grill and close the lid. Allow to cook until the chicken is cooked through and the internal temperature reads 160 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter. Discard the oregano bundle. Top with the basil and serve.
